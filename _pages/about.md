I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under the mentorship of Prof. [Guy Van den Broeck](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/) in the [StarAI Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/members/), I explore to unravel the complexities of large models. I am keenly investigating the tractability and reasoning capabilities of these substantial models, dedicated to enhancing their tractability and reliability.

Before my doctoral studies, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in a joint major of Computer Science and Mathematics at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu), where I was deeply involved in bounding-box inference within the context of model-based Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Erin Talvitie](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/erinjtalvitie).
